this is a note for a user whose roblox user is BLOODHOUND

Sorry for the silence,
you don't need to make a compiler or anything though if you do it's impressive
you just need python from python.org installed on your computer
then just run it in vscode, then stop it and open output.txt
you should see a catweb JSON "Magically" appear there, select all (ctrl + a/ cmd + a on mac) and either copy(not reccomended) or cut(reccomended) it
you can then open catweb, go to your site, and import hte JSON
you can also add as many characters or letters or anything hat is to be recognized by your encoder into the respective table

good luck and have fun lol
