this is a note for a user whose roblox user is BLOODHOUND

Sorry for the silence,
you don't need to make aa compiler or anything though if you do it's impressive
you just need python from python.org installed on your computer
then just run it in vscode and copy the printed output and import it as a json into catweb
you can also add as many characters or letters or anything hat is to be recognized by your encoder into the respective table

have fun lol
