Sorry for the silence,
you don't need to make a compiler or anything though if you do it's impressive
you just need python from python.org installed on your computer
then just run it in vscode, then stop it and open output.txt
you should see a catweb JSON "Magically" appear there, select all (ctrl + a/ cmd + a on mac) and either copy(not reccomended) or cut(reccomended) it
you can then open catweb, go to your site, and import hte JSON
you can also add as many characters or letters or anything hat is to be recognized by your encoder into the respective table
#
if you don't want to read all that, here's a more formatted method

## step 0
Make sure you have both **Python** from **python.org** and **Vscode** installed.
Then, you can Download the contents of this Repo into a folder where you want to run this

## step 1
Open **your folder** in vscode (`rightclick -> Open with -> Vscode`)
Go to `ids.py` and click on the `run` button

## step 2
go to `output.txt`, if the code ran properly you should see a full catweb JSON in it
copy/cut the contents from it
```
ctrl + a (or cmd + a on mac)
ctrl + x (oe cmd + x on max)
```
you should see the text disappear
## Step 3
Open catweb and import the given json to your site
you can call the functions `encode` and `decode` in the new encoding script

good luck and have fun lol
